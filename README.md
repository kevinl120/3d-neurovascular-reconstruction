# 3d-neurovascular-reconstruction

Reconstruction of cereberovascular networks from 2D projections using deep neural networks.

### Considerations

- Voxelized reconstruction vs. direct morphological reconstruction
- LSTM vs FF network
- Possible Models: 3DR2N2, DeepMVS, GAN/VAE
- Data augmentation
  - Generate artificial morphological data, possibly using a GAN network
  - Transformations: rotations, reflections, etc.
